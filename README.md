This is a Java program to convert between the system numbers.

The program can convert between binary, quaternary, octal, decmial, and hexadecimal number systems.

The program provides two ways to use it:

* You can use it just as a converter. So, you provide the number you want to convert and the number system you want to convert to
  and get the answer. (mode 1)

* It can gives you random numbers in a system of your choice to convert them to another number system of your choice too.
  It gives you unlimited tries to provide the correct answer and suggests to show the correct answer after some failed tries.
  You can use the program this way as a practice. (mode 2)
